These plugins were written as part of my attempts to understand Nagios.
They add functionality that, as far as I can tell, Nagios itself does
not provide. This includes any mechanism for maintaining persistent
state between plugin invocations, so that, for example, they can report
on the rate of change of various statistical counters, like CPU usage,
disk and network I/O, and the like. So I implemented my own mechanism
for doing this.

They use the python3-nagiosplugin convenience wrapper
<https://packages.debian.org/stretch/python3-nagiosplugin> for
interfacing to Nagios.
